# Water_Level_Detection_with_SOCKET_PROGRAMMING
**Water level detection using SOCKET PROGRAMMING**


The server is from where the video feed is taken as input runs it Through a loop to capture video frames performs live water levl detection   
the threshold is set to 50% anything higher is giving output "High level" and vice versa gives "Low level"

* The first code of High or Low works on the logic of calculating Contour area and if more than 50% of frame size, considers water level as high and Vice versa  

* The second code gives u an accurate percentage upto 5 decimal value on the level of water.

Then we Serialize and send video frame and water level information to client
The output is shown on the client video stream.
